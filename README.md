# Stock-Screener-Platform
A web based application that enables users to gain insights about stocks. We have two time frames which are Intraday (5min) and Daily. User needs to choose among them and needs to enter the stock ticker symbol to get 5 records of latest information regarding the stock.
We get the following information regarding a stock:

-> Open

-> High

-> Low

-> Close

-> Volume

We can further added interested stocks to the watchlist so that we can have an easier reference to them. We can later delete a stock from watchlist if no longer interested in it. It supports local user authentication as of now.



Future Work:

Get more timeframes like weekly and monthly

Paginate data to retrieve more than 5 records

Try to create a chart for better user viewing experience

Offer Oauth Logins(Google, Facebook, Twitter)
