# Stock-Screener-Platform
A web based application that enables users to gain insights about stocks. We have four time frames which are Intraday (5min), Daily, Weekly and Monthly. User needs to choose among them and needs to enter the stock ticker symbol to get a chart showing the close price in that timeframe. Further the user gets the company description, an overall market sentiment based on different news sources. Followed by the financial data for the company. Has an option to download the data in a csv format for the required stock and timeframe.

We can further added interested stocks to the watchlist so that we can have an easier reference to them. We can later delete a stock from watchlist if no longer interested in it. It supports local user authentication as of now.

We have added the Notelist Feature where users can add, edit or delete notes which they would like to keep notes regarding a particular stock, helping users to track info, patterns etc they would like to remember.
